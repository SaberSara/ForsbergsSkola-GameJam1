# ForsbergsSkola-GameJam1
First Forsbergs Skola Game Jam for 2021 - On the theme of "Let's Go Bananas !" 

## IMPORTANT (download and usages rights)
A repo created for **"The game jam"** purpose only

### Game concept
- ***Game Title: NABANAMA***
- ***Game Genre : Endless Runner***
- ***Game Perspective : 2.5D Side-View***
- ***Game Mode : Single Player***
- ***Target Audience : Casual*** 
- ***Core Idea: A banana gets shot from a toilet in the air and it will bounce on the ground until it loses all its speed.
Hitting the ground would make you lose some speed, hitting specific objects (“enemies”) make you gain speed and collect points.
(In the future we could implement a store where you can buy upgrades using the points/coins)
You can also jump a specific amount of times (even mid-air) to avoid collision with the ground. A counter on the screen will show how many jumps you have left.
Some objects will give you extra jumps.
The player goal is to hit as many objects as possible to collect points.***
